# Landing deployment

The landing site is a Next.js static export served by **GitHub Pages**, with
Cloudflare providing DNS, HTTPS, Worker routes, and the old-domain redirects.
The public origin is `https://orchestrator.inc`.

`.github/workflows/deploy-landing.yml` builds `frontend/src/landing/out` and
deploys it on landing changes to `main`, every six hours, or a manual dispatch.
The schedule refreshes release/download data. The GitHub Pages custom domain
is a repository setting, not a Cloudflare Pages project or a build environment
variable. An Actions-based Pages deployment does not use a `CNAME` file.

## Domain configuration

- GitHub repository Settings → Pages → Custom domain: `orchestrator.inc`.
- Cloudflare `orchestrator.inc`: proxied apex A records pointing to GitHub Pages
  (`185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`).
- `www.orchestrator.inc`: a redirect Worker custom domain that sends traffic to
  `https://orchestrator.inc`.
- Cloudflare `useao.dev`, `aoagents.dev`, and `ao-agents.com`: keep apex DNS
  proxied. The `www.useao.dev`, `www.aoagents.dev`, and `www.ao-agents.com`
  aliases are Worker custom domains with Cloudflare-managed DNS and TLS. Redirect
  only the explicitly configured landing hostnames to
  `https://orchestrator.inc`, preserving the path and query
  string. Use a permanent **308** redirect to preserve the method/body for old
  form submissions as well as ordinary page navigation.
- Do not redirect other `aoagents.dev` subdomains: the cloud API, staging API,
  and other services have independent origins. Keep email DNS records and the
  Android application ID `aoagents.dev` unchanged.

The `ao-landing-domain-redirect` Worker implements these redirects. Its source
and Wrangler configuration live under `cloudflare/domain-redirect*`. It uses
an exact hostname allowlist and replaces only the scheme and host, preserving
the encoded path and query string. Deploy it separately from the static site:

```bash
wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/domain-redirect.wrangler.toml
```

The `useao.dev` apex records must be proxied for their Worker route to execute.
The `www.useao.dev` custom domain is managed by Cloudflare. A successful
`curl --resolve` check against Cloudflare only verifies the staged edge
configuration, not public readiness.
After enabling the proxy, verify public DNS and HTTP/HTTPS redirects without
`--resolve`.

Existing, more-specific old-domain API and pass routes remain active for
compatibility; the catch-all landing redirect does not replace those Workers.

These existing Workers must also have routes on the new domain; GitHub Pages
cannot execute the application's API handlers:

| Route | Worker |
| --- | --- |
| `orchestrator.inc/api/cloud-waitlist*` | `ao-cloud-waitlist` |
| `orchestrator.inc/api/testimonial-submissions*` | `ao-cloud-waitlist` |
| `orchestrator.inc/hackathons/syndicate/pass*` | `ao-syndicate-pass-router` |

The deployed `ao-cloud-waitlist` Worker handles both form routes. The two source
examples under `cloudflare/` are separate handlers; do not overwrite the
combined live Worker with just one of them. Browser forms use same-origin
relative URLs. New-domain forms therefore do not depend on the CORS response
header. Old cached pages continue posting to the retained, more-specific
old-domain Worker routes without a cross-origin redirect. If those routes are
later replaced by redirects, first make the combined Worker accept both
explicitly allowed origins during that transition.

## Asset caching

GitHub Pages sends `cache-control: max-age=600` for HTML and `max-age=14400`
for every other file, and it has no way to override that: Actions-based Pages
deployments ignore a `_headers` file, so this cannot be fixed in the repo. The
effect is that a visitor returning after four hours re-downloads the entire
JS bundle, the fonts, and all artwork even though none of it changed.

Cloudflare proxies the apex, so the headers are fixed there. Two rules, both
under the `orchestrator.inc` zone:

1. **Cache Rule** — "Next static assets", expression
   `(http.host eq "orchestrator.inc" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/_next/static/"))`,
   Edge TTL *Override origin* 1 year, Browser TTL *Override origin* 1 year.
   Turbopack content-hashes every filename under `/_next/static/`, so a changed
   file is always a new URL and can never be served stale.
2. **Response Header Transform Rule** — same expression, set
   `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. The Cache Rule alone
   cannot emit `immutable`, which is what stops a reload from revalidating.

Artwork under `/optimized/`, `/app-icons/` and `/docs/logos/` is *not*
content-hashed (`optimize-images.mjs` writes stable names), so give it its own
Transform Rule with `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800`
rather than a year.

Verify after a deploy:

```bash
curl -sI https://orchestrator.inc/_next/static/chunks/<hashed>.js | grep -i cache-control
# expect: cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## Cutover and verification

Add the domain to Cloudflare and change its Porkbun nameservers first. Prepare
DNS and Worker routes next. Change the GitHub Pages custom domain, verify HTTPS
on `orchestrator.inc`, then enable the old-domain redirects. Deploy the
updated static export so canonical metadata, sitemap, feeds, and public links
use the new origin.

```bash
cd frontend/src/landing
npm ci
npm run build
curl -I https://orchestrator.inc/
curl -I 'https://useao.dev/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'https://www.useao.dev/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'https://aoagents.dev/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'https://www.aoagents.dev/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'https://ao-agents.com/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'https://www.ao-agents.com/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I 'http://www.orchestrator.inc/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -IL 'https://www.orchestrator.inc/docs/installation/?utm_source=migration-check'
curl -I https://orchestrator.inc/hackathons/syndicate/pass/
curl -i -X OPTIONS https://orchestrator.inc/api/cloud-waitlist/
curl -i -X OPTIONS https://orchestrator.inc/api/testimonial-submissions/
```

Expect the landing page and pass to return 200, old-domain requests to return
308 with the same path/query on `orchestrator.inc`, and API preflights to reach
the Workers. Verify `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, and page canonical metadata
refer to `orchestrator.inc`. Check HTTP and HTTPS and the `www` variants without
following redirects first, then follow them to detect loops. Avoid submitting
real form data as a deployment check.

## Rollback

1. Remove the legacy-domain redirect Worker routes, then restore the GitHub Pages
   custom domain to `useao.dev` and verify the apex returns 200. Keep its
   original proxied apex records and all more-specific API/pass routes.
2. Remove the `www.orchestrator.inc` Worker custom domain only after the restored
   `useao.dev` origin is healthy. Cloudflare manages custom-domain DNS and TLS;
   detaching one does not guarantee replacement DNS or TLS is ready.
3. Keep `orchestrator.inc` serving during a full rollback for clients that
   cached permanent redirects. Do not add a reverse permanent redirect that
   could create a loop. These rollback operations have not been exercised
   against production.
