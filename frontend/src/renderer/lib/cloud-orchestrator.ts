// A cloud project has no locally-configured orchestrator agent (that config
// lives in the local daemon's project settings), so the launchers must not

// is spawned as a control-plane session in its own sandbox, exactly like a
// cloud worker session; the worker swaps in the orchestrator system prompt
// server-side based on the session kind.
//
// Deliberately hook-free: the launchers (sidebar row, board, topbar, command
// palette) render everywhere, and subscribing them to the cloud session/org
// queries just for this click handler would fire cloud requests on every
// mount. The client is built lazily from the settings query cache instead.
// A Cloud worker image currently ships these three harnesses. This ordering
// preserves the former Codex default whenever it is available, while allowing
// a user's connected Claude Code or Cursor credential to run the orchestrator
// when Codex is not connected.
