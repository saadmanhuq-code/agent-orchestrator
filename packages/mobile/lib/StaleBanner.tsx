/**
 * Says out loud that the rows below are older than they look.
 *
 * The screens used to put their failure copy inside `ListEmptyComponent`, which
 * means it only ever appeared when there was nothing to show. A list that had
 * already loaded kept its rows and said nothing at all — so a board whose daemon
 * died an hour ago looked exactly like a live one, and people act on those rows.
 *
 * This component owns the clock rather than taking an age as a prop, and that is
 * deliberate: `useStaleness` re-renders whatever calls it every tick, so a screen
 * that called it would re-render its whole list on a timer. Here the cost is one
 * small component. It also self-gates to null when the data is current, so
 * screens can render it unconditionally.
