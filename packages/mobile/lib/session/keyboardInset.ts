 * Bottom padding the root view owes to clear the keyboard.

 * `height` is whatever the platform's keyboard event reported, and the two
 * platforms report different things:
 *
 * - iOS measures from the bottom of the screen, so the value already spans the
 *   home indicator. Reserve it as-is.
 * - Android reports `imeInsets.bottom - systemBars.bottom` (see
 *   `checkForKeyboardEvents` in ReactRootView.java) — the keyboard height with
 *   the navigation bar already subtracted. But our root view runs edge-to-edge
 *   underneath that nav bar, so the keyboard actually covers the full
 *   `imeInsets.bottom`. Padding by the reported height alone left the dock
 *   short by exactly the nav-bar inset, which is why the input row was cut in
 *   half under gesture nav (~24dp) and hidden outright under 3-button nav
 *   (48dp). Add the inset back.
