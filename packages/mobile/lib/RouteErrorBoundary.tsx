/**
 * What a route shows when it throws while rendering, instead of the app
 * terminating. expo-router only installs one where a route file opts in with
 * `export { RouteErrorBoundary as ErrorBoundary }` (or `SheetErrorBoundary`).
 * `RouteErrorBoundary.test.ts` requires every route file to be placed.
 *
 * Not on `app/_layout.tsx` with these fallbacks. expo-router wraps the route's own
 * component, and for that layout the component is what renders ThemeProvider. Both
 * fallbacks read the theme, and `useTheme` throws outside the provider, so the
 * fallback would throw in its turn.
 *
 * A fallback on any route leaves expo-updates' rollback as it was.
 * `ErrorRecovery.handleContentDidAppear` counts a launch as good once native
 * content first appears, and ExpoRoot's own SafeAreaProvider mounts a native view
 * before any route renders (it renders its children only once that view reports
 * insets; expo-router 57 passes it no `initialMetrics` on native). So by the time
 * a route renders, rollback is already off, boundary or not; it still covers a
 * throw before that mount, while the router sets itself up.
