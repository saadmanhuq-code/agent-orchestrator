// checkpointSafetyNetInterval is the coarse periodic backstop that captures
// in-progress work the Stop hook has not yet flushed. The Stop hook (turn
// completion) is the primary, event-driven trigger; this timer only exists so a
// long turn, or a delete/restore in the MIDDLE of the first turn (before any
// Stop has fired), still has a recent checkpoint to restore from instead of
// re-running from the task prompt. It is deliberately coarse — the checkpoint is
// change-detected, so a tick with no new work is a no-op — and is not the old
// 15s polling model. A future change (see the tool-use event trigger discussion)
// can drive capture off file-modifying tool events and drop or lengthen this.
// A var (not const) so tests can shorten it.

// runCheckpointBridge serves a local unix socket that the harness Stop hook pokes
// on every turn completion (see runHook in ao-cloud-agent). Each poke runs one
// durable-restore checkpoint. The primary trigger is event-driven off turn
// completion; a coarse periodic safety net (checkpointSafetyNetInterval) also
// pokes so in-progress work is not lost when a turn is interrupted or restored
// before it completes. A single-slot trigger channel coalesces bursts (from any
// producer) so overlapping pokes collapse into one in-flight checkpoint, and the
// checkpoint itself is change-detected so an unchanged poke is a no-op. Adding a
// new trigger later is just another producer calling poke(). Blocks until ctx is
// done.
